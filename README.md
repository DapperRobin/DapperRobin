Hello!

I'm DapperRobin, and welcome to my profile! I'm a university student in Hungary, currently studying IT engineering with a focus on game development. In my free time, I enjoy playing and creating games using the Unity game engine.

I embarked on my game development journey last summer, intending to create engaging games that bring fun to a wide audience. My main project right now is a 2D isometric dungeon crawler. While it's still a work in progress, I plan to release early builds soon so you can follow along with its development. I also enjoy participating in game jams to push my skills further and connect with other developers.

Iâ€™m especially interested in exploring AI and procedural generation in games, so stay tuned for updates and new releases as I continue building my projects!
